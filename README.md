Summary 

As you can see the README is a crucial part of your projects and writing a well-documented README is a skill. By the time you graduate you will be comfortable with markdown and writing good software documentation. 
The README should be started with your project and never as an afterthought. This way you can add any bugs that crop up and ideas you may have along the way. 

The README is your direct line of communication to the Assessor within this course and to a potential client/collaborator in your career as a developer. This is a powerful tool for communicating your ideas and process and should be treated with the utmost importance.
